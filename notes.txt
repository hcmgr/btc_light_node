construct_network_msg():
    -shows a really nice method of converting different 
     data into bytes that we send down a socket
    -from it, we can see that memcpy takes:
        &dest - destination pointer
        &src - source pointer
        n - number of bytes to copy
----
recv():
    -will block until either:
        -buffer filled OR;
        -socket closed
